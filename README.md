# DNA Sequence Analyzer

## Overview
This Python-based DNA Sequence Analyzer processes and analyzes **FASTA-formatted DNA sequences**, providing insights such as nucleotide composition, GC content, sequence translation, and mutation detection. This project is useful for bioinformatics research, molecular biology studies, and genomic data exploration.

## Features
- **Nucleotide Frequency Analysis**: Calculates the count of A, T, G, and C bases.
- **GC Content Calculation**: Determines GC percentage for assessing sequence stability.
- **Reverse Complement**: Generates the reverse complement of DNA strands.
- **Transcription & Translation**: Converts DNA to mRNA and protein sequences.
- **Mutation Detection**: Identifies SNPs and sequence variations.
- **FASTA File Parsing**: Reads and processes multi-sequence FASTA files.
